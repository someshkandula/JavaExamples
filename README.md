# Generics And Collections

#### Generics

Why do we use Generics?
1) Stronger type check at compiler time.
2) Avoid casting during reading the values.
3) We can implement a generic algorithm for sorting String/Double/Integers

Example
1) Generic Class
GenericClass.java
2) Generic Methods
AppGM.java

3) Bounded Type parameters
Bounded type parameters allow you to invoke methods defined in the bounds 
For Example 
1) extends comparable -> we can use compare() method to compare items

2) a method that operates on numbers might only want to accept instances of Number or its subclasses.



#### Collections
